Since RR is not natively supported by commercial hardware, it is necessary to wrap the provided APIs with a RR service.
Steps for using RR(Overview):
1- Write a service definition(A plain text)
2- Develop an object that implements the service definition. 
3- Expose the implemented service as obj
4- Create and Register a "Transport"(Transports provide connection between nodes)
    4.1- Initialize and register 'LocalTransport'
        ('LocalTransport' provides comm. within the same computer)
        So, local Transport is not able to comm. over the network
        Use "TcpTransport" to comm over the network
    4.2- Initialize adn register 'TcpTransport'
5- Register service type and the service

6- Shutdown

Steps for using RR(Some more Details):
1- Write a service definition(A plain text)
    TODO

2- Develop an object that implements the service definition.(in Python)
    RR          --->    Python
    Properties          Properties
    Functions           Functions
    Event               Implemented through 'EventHook' class that must be present as a variable in class
    Wire                immplemented as properties, initialized to None and will be set by the RR node when the Obj is exposed as service.
    Callback            immplemented as properties, initialized to None and will be set by the RR node when the Obj is exposed as service.

    Note: RR is multithreaded. All members and funct.s can be called concurrently. So, use a thread lock(mutex)!

3- Expose the implemented service
    TODO(Nothing much actually)
    # Initialize the object in the service
    obj=Create_impl( )
    obj.Init(serial_port_name )


4- Create and Register a "Transport"(Transports provide connection between nodes)
    4.1- Initialize and register 'LocalTransport'
        'LocalTransport' created  with RR.LocalTransport()
        A server is started with a "NodeName" using function StartServerAsNodeName(NodeName) (NodeName can be the same as the service name)
        A 'NodeName' can only be used in the same computer one at a time.
        Register with RRN.registerTransport(.) 

        ('LocalTransport' provides comm. within the same computer)
        So, local Transport is not able to comm. over the network
        Use "TcpTransport" to comm over the network

    4.2- Initialize and register 'TcpTransport'
        'TcpTransport' created with  RR.TcpTransport()
        Register with RRN.registerTransport(.) 
        Server is started with a port number using function StartServer("port number")

        Note: There is a Port Sharer service that allows multiple nodes to listen on port 48653(Standard RR port). If you would like to use Port Sharer, use StartServerUsingPortSharer instead of StartServer.

5- Register service type and the service
    RRN.RegisterServiceType(service definition(the plain text))
    RRN.RegisterService("Name of the service","fully qualified Robot Raconteur type of the object","the object to expose as
a service")
    
     A node can have multiple services registered as long as they have different
names

6- Shutdown
    The object is shutdown
    The Robot Raconteur node is shutdown
