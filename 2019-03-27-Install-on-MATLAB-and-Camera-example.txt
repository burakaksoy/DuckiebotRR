I installed RR with MATLAB.
I run RR example SimpleWebcamService.py on Duckiebot and run SimpleWebcamClient.m on Remote PC.
I could get camera images successfully.

DETAILS:
INSTALL RR MATLAB library on only Remote PC.
(Here we are assuming that you have already installed RR python on Duckiebot and you have MATLAB installed in your remote PC.)
(Further details can be find at: https://github.com/johnwason/RobotRaconteur_MATLAB_Examples AND https://robotraconteur.com/documentation)

- Go to Download Page of RR(https://robotraconteur.com/Download) and download RR MATLAB for your pc(I did it on Ubuntu 16.04
-  Simply unpack the archive and add the directory that contains ”RobotRaconteurMex.*” to the path of MATLAB.(If you don't know how to add a directory to the path of MATLAB, here is a refence(Yes, you could have searched by yourself too): http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/local-apps/matlabhelp/techdoc/ref/addpath.html)

- Start the camera service on duckiebot from the RR directory in Duckiebot execute this command:
python SimpleWebcamService.py
(You will see that the camera light will be on.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
TO GET CAMERA IMAGE ON MATLAB Remote PC;
- Now on your Remote PC, Download SimpleWebcamClient.m and SimpleWebcamClient_stream.m (from https://github.com/johnwason/RobotRaconteur_MATLAB_Examples)
- Change some lines in SimpleWebcamClient.m and SimpleWebcamClient_stream.m:
in this line:
c_host=RobotRaconteur.ConnectService('rr+tcp://localhost:2355?service=Webcam');
replace localhost with the ip adress of duckiebot (eg: 192.168.43.141). Or with the name that you already defined the host adress in your /etc/hosts file (eg. Duckiebot 192.168.43.141). So it means you can directly type Duckiebot instead of localhost if you already defined the host adress.
- Change some lines in SimpleWebcamClient.m:
comment out c2=c_host.get_Webcams(1)
comment out frame2=WebcamImageToIM(c2.CaptureFrame());
comment out these 3 lines in sequence
figure
imshow(frame2);
title(c2.Name)

- After the changes save the file.
- Now We are ready to see the images on Remote PC:
- Simply Run SimpleWebcamClient.m file on MATLAB.
- Or Run SimpleWebcamClient_stream.m on MATLAB.

note: 2355 is the port number which is defined on SimpleWebcamService.py file. 
note: the First Run file just will show a single image, the second run file will show continuous images(although it is slow)
