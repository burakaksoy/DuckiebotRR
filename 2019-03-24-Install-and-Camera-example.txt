SUMMARY:
I installed RR with PYTHON
I run RR example SimpleWebcamService.py on Duckiebot and run SimpleWebcamClient.py on Remote PC.
I could get camera images successfully.

DETAILS:
INSTALL RR with PYTHON into Duckiebot
Install RR python library on Remote PC and Duckiebot:
(Further details can be find at: https://github.com/johnwason/RobotRaconteur_Python_Examples AND https://robotraconteur.com/documentation)
- Download Required softwares(execute on both Duckie and RemotePC):
sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-serial python-numpy python-opencv python-pygame
sudo usermod -a -G dialout pi
sudo usermod -a -G video pi
(Change “pi” to your username in the usermod command)

- Go to Download Page of RR(https://robotraconteur.com/Download) and download RR python for your pc(I did it on Ubuntu 16.04) and duckiebot.
- Run the commands below on Remote PC after downloading RR:
cd /
sudo tar xvzf /Downloads/RobotRaconteur-0.8.1-beta-Python.linux-x86_64-py2.7-2016-07-18.tar
(replace with the correct tar file for your platform and latest Robot Raconteur version)

- Run the commands below on Duckie after downloading RR:
cd /
sudo tar xvzf ~/RobotRaconteur-0.8.1-beta-Python.linux-armhf-py2.7-2016-07-18.tar

- Download SimpleWebcamService.py from https://github.com/johnwason/RobotRaconteur_Python_Examples into Duckiebot
- Change some lines in SimpleWebcamService.py:
camera_names=[(0,"Left"),(1,"Right")] 
line to 
camera_names=[(0,"Cam1")]
because we have only 1 camera on duckiebot.

- Normally, RaspberryPiCam is not detected as a webcam by duckiebot. So you need to make sure that V4L2 drivers installed on duckiebot. Install with command:
sudo apt-get install v4l-utils

- If installed, then add this line to your /etc/modules file on duckiebot:
bcm2835-v4l2
- Then save it and reboot duckiebot.
- After reboot you can see the camera is detected with this command(resource:https://askubuntu.com/questions/348838/how-to-check-available-webcams-from-the-command-line):
ls -ltrh /dev/video*
or
v4l2-ctl --list-devices

(This solution to detect RasperryPiCam as webcam is found from one of the comments of this blog page: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/01/04/unifying-picamera-and-cv2-videocapture-into-a-single-class-with-opencv/)
(If this solution would not work I would also try this, but it would require more changes on SimpleWebcamService.py too: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/03/30/accessing-the-raspberry-pi-camera-with-opencv-and-python/)

- As last step on duckiebot to start the service, run the file using this command:
python SimpleWebcamService.py
(You will see that the camera light will be on.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
TO GET CAMERA IMAGE ON PYTHON Remote PC;
- Now on your Remote PC, Download SimpleWebcamClient.py and SimpleWebcamClient_streaming.py (from https://github.com/johnwason/RobotRaconteur_Python_Examples)
- Change some lines in SimpleWebcamClient.py:
comment out c2=c_host.get_Webcams(1)
comment out frame2=WebcamImageToMat(c2.CaptureFrame())
comment out cv2.imshow(c2.Name,frame2)

- We are ready to see the images with one of the commands below on Remote PC:
python SimpleWebcamClient.py rr+tcp://localhost:2355?service=Webcam
python SimpleWebcamClient_streaming.py rr+tcp://localhost:2355?service=Webcam

note: replace localhost with the ip adress of duckiebot (eg: 192.168.43.141). Or with the name that you already defined the host adress in your /etc/hosts file (eg. Duckiebot 192.168.43.141) you can directly type Duckiebot instead of localhost.
note: 2355 is the port number which is defined on SimpleWebcamService.py file. 
note: the First command just will show a single image, the second command will show continuous images(although it is slow)
note: if you have multiple python versions in your system, while executing you may need to use python2 command instead of python command to specify the version as 2.
